# Module_3_Challenge

## This challenge was an introduction to Jupyter Lab through the UNCC FinTech Bootcamp. The challenge was to analyze the price spread of bitcoin between the two exchanges Bitstamp and Coinbase. Depending on the spread size on certain dates, there could be arbitrage opportunities for investors. My job was to find three dates where there were arbitrage opportunities.
